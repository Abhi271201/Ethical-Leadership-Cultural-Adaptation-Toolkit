        <h2>🗣️ Leadership Communication Style Statement</h2>
        <p>
            My leadership communication style is built on transparency, active listening, and empowering team members. I
            believe in clear, concise messaging that fosters trust and inclusivity. I adapt my tone and delivery based
            on context—whether it's motivating the team during a high-stakes project or facilitating open dialogue
            during feedback sessions. My goal is to create a psychologically safe environment where every voice matters.

        <p><strong>🔹 Start with Positives:</strong><br>
            "Thank you for your hard work on the last sprint. Your problem-solving during the UI bug fix was excellent."
        </p>

        <p><strong>🔹 Clarify Area for Growth:</strong><br>
            "I noticed some delays in updating the Jira tickets. Can we discuss what might be getting in the way?"
        </p>

        <p><strong>🔹 Explore Solutions Collaboratively:</strong><br>
            "Would a daily 5-minute sync help? Or do you prefer another system of accountability?"
        </p>

        <p><strong>🔹 Set Goals:</strong><br>
            "Let’s aim to complete task updates within 24 hours for the next two weeks."

            "I believe in your ability to improve this. Let's reconnect next week to see how it's going."
